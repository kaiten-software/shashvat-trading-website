# Shashvat Trading: Technical Knowledge Scopes

## 1. Polymer Technical Property Mapping
When a customer asks for a property, the chatbot must map it to the corresponding business benefit:

| Technical Property | Business/Operational Impact |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| **Melt Flow Index (MFI)** | Processability speed, thin-wall capability, cycle time reduction. |
| **Tensile Strength** | Resistance to stretching/breaking, structural integrity under load. |
| **Flexural Modulus** | Stiffness and rigidity, important for load-bearing components like crates or bumpers. |
| **IZOD Impact Strength** | Durability at low temperatures, resistance to cracking on drop/impact. |
| **HDT (Heat Deflection)** | Performance in high-heat environments (e.g., automotive engine rooms). |

## 2. Industry-Specific Grade Selection
### Automotive (OEMs & Tier 1)
- **Primary Grades**: ABS, PC/ABS blends, Glass-filled Polyamide (PA6/PA66).
- **Focus**: Weight reduction, impact safety, UV stability for exterior parts.

### Packaging (FMCG & Industrial)
- **Primary Grades**: LLDPE (Stretch films), HDPE (Rigid containers), PP (Lids/closures).
- **Focus**: Moisture barrier, puncture resistance, food-grade compliance (FDA/EU).

### Medical & Healthcare
- **Primary Grades**: Medical-grade PP, HDPE.
- **Focus**: Gamma/ETO sterilization stability, low extractables, high clarity.

## 3. Blog-Based Technical Insights
The chatbot should reference the following internal insights for deeper context:
- **Polyethylene Variants**: Explain the density differences between LDPE (flexibility), LLDPE (puncture resistance), and HDPE (rigidity).
- **Sustainability**: Discuss bio-circular resins and "Mass Balance" approaches for net-zero goals.
- **PP Comparison**: Distinguish between Homopolymer (stiffest), Random Copolymer (clarity), and Impact Copolymer (extreme durability).

## 4. Brand Specifics (Partnership Context)
- **LG Chem**: Focus on high-performance LUPOL and engineering plastics.
- **SABIC**: Focus on global availability and diversified polyolefins.
- **IRPC**: Highlight POLIMAXX ABS and unique Thai-manufactured grades.
- **Formosa Plastics**: Reliable partner for PVC and commodity PE/PP.

## 5. Non-Technical "Soft" Boundaries
- **Logistics**: The chatbot should mention Shashvat's global distribution network but defer shipping/freight cost queries to the sales team.
- **Pricing**: ABSOLUTELY NO FIXED PRICING. Market prices fluctuate; users must request a quote for current daily rates.
